The bacterial community is reported to vary between case and control for a number of diseases [@Turnbaugh2008; @Baxter2016; @Sze2015; @Bonfili2017]. However, for diseases like obesity, the taxa identified have varied widely depending on the study [@Turnbaugh2008; @Zupancic2012]. Although some of the differences could be attributed to study design, error introduced during the 16S rRNA gene sequencing workflow could also be another source of variation. A typical 16S rRNA gene sequencing workflow can be divided into preservation, extraction, PCR, and sequencing steps. The preservation and extraction stages of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing workflow have been the most extensively studied [@contamination_Salter2014; @preservation_Song_2016; @storage_Bassis_2017; @review_Kim_2017]. For preservation and extraction stages of the workflow, it has been consistently found that there are errors in the observed bacterial community composition based on the kits used, but that these differences are smaller than the overall biological difference measured between samples with different kits [@preservation_Song_2016; @storage_Bassis_2017]. Since these studies use the same PCR approach while varying preservation or extraction method, the contribution of PCR error to this overall workflow is not as well characterized.




Invitrogen Accuprime: Taq DNA polymerase, Pyrococcus species GB-D polymerase (proofreading enzyme that possesses a 3' → 5' exonuclease activity), and PlatinumTM Taq Antibody https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/accuprimetaqhifi_man.pdf

Platinum: Has a souped up version of Taq polymerase (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/11304011)

Phusion: Pyrococcus-like enzyme fused with a processivity-enhancing domain https://www.neb.com/products/m0530-phusion-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase

Q5: thermostable DNA polymerase with 3´→ 5´ exonuclease activity, fused to a processivity-enhancing Sso7d domain to support robust DNA amplification https://www.neb.com/-/media/catalog/datacards-or-manuals/m0491datasheet-lot0041207.pdf

Kappa: a novel B-family DNA polymerase, engineered to have increased affinity for DNA, without the need for accessory proteins or DNA binding domains. The intrinsic high processivity of the enzyme results in significant improvement in yield, speed and sensitivity when compared to wild-type B-family DNA polymerases. https://www.neb.com/-/media/catalog/datacards-or-manuals/m0491datasheet-lot0041207.pdf
